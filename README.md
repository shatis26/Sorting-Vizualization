Sorting Visualization Project

This project is a visual representation of various sorting algorithms, designed to help users better understand how these algorithms work. The visualization displays the process of sorting an array of data step by step, allowing users to see how elements are compared, swapped, and moved into their correct positions.

The project includes popular sorting algorithms such as Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort and Quick Sort. Users can select an algorithm to visualize, control the speed of the visualization, and observe the efficiency of different sorting techniques in real-time.
